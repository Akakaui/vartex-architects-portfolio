        intent: "A vocational training center conceived as a contemporary reinterpretation of communal learning spaces, emphasizing climate responsiveness and cultural continuity.",
        fullIntent: "The project explores how architecture can support skill development through spatial clarity, environmental responsiveness, and material honesty. The aim was to create an environment that encourages collaboration while remaining calm, functional, and deeply connected to its cultural context.",
        constraints: [
            "Hot–humid climate requiring passive cooling strategies",
            "Educational program combining workshops, classrooms, and shared spaces",
            "Cultural reference to traditional Igbo courtyard organization",
            "Emphasis on locally appropriate materials and construction logic",
            "Need for durability and long-term adaptability"
        ],
        solution: "The building is organized around a series of shared courtyards that act as social and environmental anchors. These spaces promote interaction while improving cross-ventilation and daylight penetration. Thick masonry walls and controlled openings moderate heat gain, while deep overhangs provide shading and protection from heavy rainfall.",
        spatialStrategy: "Natural ventilation, filtered daylight, and shaded outdoor spaces work together to reduce reliance on mechanical systems. The overall massing balances enclosure and openness, creating a sequence of calm, breathable learning environments.",

        intent: "A residential project exploring the dialogue between classical architectural language and contemporary spatial requirements.",
        fullIntent: "The project investigates how classical architectural principles can be adapted to modern living without losing balance, proportion, or relevance. Rather than replicating historical forms, the design reinterprets classical order within a contemporary residential framework.",

            "Climatic considerations influencing light and ventilation"
        ],
        solution: "A symmetrical façade establishes a clear architectural identity rooted in classical composition. This formal expression contrasts with a more flexible internal layout, where spaces are organized asymmetrically to respond to functional needs and site conditions.",
        spatialStrategy: "The transition from exterior formality to interior fluidity creates a layered architectural experience. Light-filled interiors and controlled ventilation enhance comfort while reinforcing the building’s sense of permanence and order.",
