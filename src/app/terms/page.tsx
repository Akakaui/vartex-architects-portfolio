                            <p>Due to the conceptual and time-intensive nature of architectural design, our financial terms are strictly enforced:</p>
                            <ul className="list-disc list-outside ml-5 flex flex-col gap-3">
                                <li><strong>Non-Refundable Retainer:</strong> A mobilization fee (retainer) must be cleared before any conceptualization, site analysis, or drafting begins.</li>
                                <li><strong>Milestone Payments:</strong> Remaining fees are tied to specific project deliverables (e.g., schematic approval, construction documents).</li>

                            <p>To ensure project momentum and protect our firm&apos;s time, standard design phases include up to three (3) minor revisions during the conceptual stage.</p>
